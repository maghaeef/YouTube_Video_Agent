      "Based on the debate transcript between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, here are the main viewpoints and statements from each:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Donald Trump:\n",
      "- **Economy:** Trump focused on condemning Harris's economic plans, claiming they would worsen the deficit and increase inflation. He argued for cutting taxes substantially and claimed that his past economic policies led to significant growth and low inflation.\n",
      "- **Immigration:** He criticized Harris for increased illegal immigration and crime, suggesting that it was damaging the country. He proposed using local police and the National Guard for mass deportations.\n",
      "- **Abortion:** Trump emphasized his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, framing it as a win for democracy by returning the power to the states. He distanced himself from the idea of a national abortion ban.\n",
      "- **Foreign Policy:** He argued that his administration was feared and respected internationally and claimed that wars and international issues worsened under the current administration.\n",
      "- **January 6th:** Trump deflected responsibility for the events at the Capitol, criticizing Pelosi for not providing adequate security.\n",
      "- **Healthcare:** He criticized Obamacare as ineffective and costly and suggested he would support a better, less expensive alternative.\n",
      "- **Climate Change:** Trump did not prioritize climate change but focused on maintaining traditional energy resources and criticized the Biden administration's approach to the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Kamala Harris:\n",
      "- **Economy:** Harris emphasized her plans to support middle-class and working families with tax credits and support for small businesses. She framed her \"Opportunity Economy\" as a contrast to Trump's tax policies favoring the wealthy.\n",
      "- **Immigration:** She highlighted her background in prosecuting transnational crime and criticized Trump for not supporting legislation that would have increased border security.\n",
      "- **Abortion:** Harris is committed to reinstating Roe v. Wade protections, criticizing Trump's abortion policies as extreme and harmful to women's rights.\n",
      "- **Foreign Policy:** Harris accused Trump of being manipulated by dictators and criticized his relationship with them, emphasizing the need for strong international alliances.\n",
      "- **January 6th:** She held Trump responsible for inciting violence and emphasized the importance of rule of law and democracy.\n",
      "- **Healthcare:** Harris supported maintaining and strengthening the Affordable Care Act, criticizing Trump's repeated attempts to dismantle it.\n",
      "- **Climate Change:** Harris argued it is a real and pressing issue and highlighted investments made in clean energy under her vice presidency to combat climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the debate revealed stark differences in policy and vision for America between Trump and Harris, with each candidate attacking the other's record and proposed policies.\n",
